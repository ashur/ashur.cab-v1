title: Hello, world.
date: TBD
---

This is the beginning of a new repository, [ashur.cab][repo]. With enough gum, paperclips and dumb luck, it will eventually serve as the source for the site https://ashur.cab/rera

At each milestone, wrong turn, or other notable decision, I'll update [this article][hello-world] to reflect the new behavior.


## Structure

Original content will live in a `src` directory at the root of this repository:

```
â””â”€â”€ src/
```

When the site is built, all contents will be generated a `dist` directory also at the root of this repository:

```
â””â”€â”€ dist/
```

### Articles

Articles will consist of Markdown files which live in a bifurcated directory `src/articles`:

```
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ articles/
        â”œâ”€â”€ drafts/
        â””â”€â”€ published/
```

When the site is built, all `.md` files in `articles/published` will be extruded\* into static HTML files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ articles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 2018/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ hello-world.html
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ articles/
        â”œâ”€â”€ drafts/
        â””â”€â”€ published/
            â””â”€â”€ 2018/
                â””â”€â”€ hello-world.md

```

> ðŸ™ˆ Files in `articles/drafts` will always be ignored
